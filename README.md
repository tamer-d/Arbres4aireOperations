N-ary Tree Implementation
This project is a mini university assignment for the Advanced Algorithms and Complexity module. It implements an N-ary tree data structure, allowing various operations such as construction, traversal, insertion, modification, deletion, and subtree extraction. The program features an interactive menu that enables users to build trees with a specified number of nodes and perform operations while measuring execution times for specific functionalities. This project aims to demonstrate the practical application of tree data structures and their associated algorithms in a clear and efficient manner.
